I'm a Ph.D. candidate at University of Minnesota. During my Ph.D. My research focus on the optimal and robust control of large scale linear systems. My goal is to establish a set of control synthesis methodology of large scale physical systems by computationally efficient optimization approaches. Now, I'm working on both the theoritical performance/robustness guarantee and practical efficiency of my methods. Any discussions with me on the topics and applications are warmly welcomed. I'm also seeking an opportunity in industry to bring those theories into practice. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
