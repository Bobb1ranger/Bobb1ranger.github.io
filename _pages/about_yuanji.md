I'm a Ph.D. candidate at University of Minnesota. During my Ph.D. My research focus on the optimal and robust control of large scale linear systems. My goal is to establish a set of control synthesis methodology of large scale physical systems by computationally efficient optimization approaches. Now, I'm working on both the theoretical performance/robustness guarantee and practical efficiency of my methods. Any discussions with me on the topics and applications are warmly welcomed. I'm also seeking an opportunity in industry to bring those theories into practice.
