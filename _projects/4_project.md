Assumption: we are given a dynamical system that is partially modelled. The feedback interconnection with its controller may occur package drop.
* What is the largest variance can be tolerated in feedback channels when our system have bounded norm uncertainty in modeling?
* What is the failure mode (adversarial disturbance) that is most likely to destabilize a time-varying system with some stochasticity?
