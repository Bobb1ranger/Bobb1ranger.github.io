Given a complex-valued $m\times n$ matrix $A$, $A^H$ denotes its hermitian conjugate.
$\ell_2^{m\times n}[Z]$ denotes the Hilbert space of sequences of $m\times n$ complex-valued matrices, with inner product defined as

$$
\langle H,G\rangle = \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} \mathrm{trace}(G^H[k]H[k]).
$$
