Abstract:
In this work, we present an explicit solution of non-strongly connected distributed $\mathcal{H}_2$ problem. Our approach uses the solution of the discrete-time algebraic Riccati equations (DARE) for standard H2 optimal controller to initiate the Youla
parameterization (YoP) and cast the distributed H2 into a convex model matching problem. Leveraging vectorization, we further transform the problem into a l2 minimization problem with a given initial state. Applying reliable model eduction, an explicit solution for the l2 minimization, from which the optimal distributed controller can be retrieved is found through an extra DARE in the vectorized state-space. We put this methodology to the test by applying it to a 4-car platoon system.
