        - title: Networked Distributed Controller Design.
          contents:
            - Multi-Agent Systems Modeling - Developed mathematical models for multi-agent environment operating under observation noises and process disturbances, with a focus on distributed decision-making and shared objectives.
            - Designed H2 oriented Multi - agent Optimal Control Framework - Formulated a dynamic programming-based recursive algorithm that blends optimal control principles with Markovian decision process to address cooperative regulation under communication delays.
            - Achieved Networked Implementation - Implemented the regulator in network-distributed manner with minimal memory usage, enabling parallel execution.
            - Multi-Robot Coordination Application - Validated the framework in a cooperative robotics task, achieving a 100% improvement in measuring noise rejection compared to decentralized PID controllers.
            - Federated Learning Application - Showcased the framework's effectiveness in enhancing convergence rates within distributed training scenarios.
        - Robust Mean Square Analysis
        - Description 3.
